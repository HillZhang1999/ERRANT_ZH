# Errant for Chinese

 Scorer used in the Coling 2020 paper [Heterogeneous Recycle Generation for Chinese Grammatical Error Correction](<https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.199.pdf>)

## Overview

Provides a way to annotate / score Chinese sentences with [ERRANT](https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant). Currently only supports the four operation level errors: insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition.

This project needs the [cilin thesaurus](https://tjzhifei.github.io/resource.html) (Tongyici Cilin(Extended)) to work properly, and is currently provided in the data folder.
